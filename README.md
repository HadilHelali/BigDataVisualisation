# BigDataVisualisation
This is a part of a big data project which encompasses both batch and data stream processing.
According to the architecture we build for this project , this is **the final part** where we visualize the resulted data from both the [batch](https://github.com/HadilHelali/BigDataBatch) and [data stream processing](https://github.com/HadilHelali/BigDataSpark).
